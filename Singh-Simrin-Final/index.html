            <p> Skid Row City Limit, Population: Too Many.</p>

            <p>It’s LA’s dead zone—void of all things glitz and glamour. Streets are lined with ratty tents and garbage, and despite the many activist groups there, it’s still in dire need of help.</p>

            <p>Well known as the homeless capital of the world, Skid Row is a dwelling for 8,000 to 11,000 homeless people according to the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. But there is more to Skid Row than homelessness; it is a breeding ground of art and culture. Behind the tents are colorful murals sprawled across the walls. And hip-hop beats echo and bounce through the dark alleyways.</p>

            <p>At this year’s Walk the Talk Parade on April 21, Skid Row residents celebrated the area’s artistic flair, as well as those who work to move the neighborhood in a positive direction. Roughly 100 participants marched from Sixth Street to Winston Street under the beating sun with desires for a better future and pride for the community’s lesser known accomplishments.</p>

            <p>The event was put on by the nonprofit Los Angeles Poverty Department, and featured dramatic performances and music by those with roots in the Skid Row neighborhood.</p>

            <p>“A lot of people think Skid Row is just a transient neighborhood, and that no one really lives there, but in fact most people live there for a long time,” said John Malpede, founder of the LA Poverty Department. “As a result, [Skid Row residents] have things that they have done to improve the neighborhood that they care about.”</p>

            <p>The LA Poverty Department, endearingly referred to as “the other LAPD” is a nonprofit organization and art movement that was created in 1985. Malpede, a decorated artist and play director founded the group after observing the impact of other volunteer organizations on the neighborhood.</p>

            <p>“Our goals were to make community on Skid Row, and to get the real deal [about Skid Row’s situation] out to normal-ville,” he said. “So bringing people together, working together—that helps create community.”</p>

    <div class="content2">
        <p> While many on Skid Row struggle to come up with basic living necessities, they find hope in the LA Poverty Department’s work. General Jeff, an eleven-year resident of the neighborhood, said the Poverty Department provides a space for the homeless to express their creativity.</p>

        <p>“Art is a very necessary outlet, and the problem is we don’t have buildings or an office to where we can actually exercise that outlet,” Jeff said. “So any opportunity we can to exert our artistic capabilities and our talents, it’s absolutely a positive for our entire community.” </p>

        <p>Among the eight people recognized this year were Vijay Gupta, founder of Street Symphony, and Cue, a rapper and pastor at Row Church. Both Gupta and Cue use music to uplift the homeless community. Former Walk the Talk awardee and community outreach worker Christopher Mack said these individuals are generous for spending their time with underrepresented, impoverished people. </p>

        <p>“There are people who are in the community that provide services above and beyond the call of duty,” Mack said. “There are actually people in the community who make a difference in people’s lives.”</p>

<!--Below is the code for the third part of the story that is presented-->

    <div class="content3">
        <p> Many members of the LA Poverty Department’s performance troupe are currently homeless. The department aims to promote these individuals. Longtime LA Poverty Department volunteer Stephanie Bell said many homeless people are motivated, but do not always have the means or opportunity to advance out of their conditions.</p>

        <p>“People associate the homeless people like, ‘Oh they’re bums,’ or ‘They don’t wanna get off the sidewalk.’” Bell said. “But that’s not true. We have people down here that are really sick.”</p>

        <p>The nonprofit helps homeless community members explore their artistic side, and encourages them to voice their needs to local government members. Some Skid Row residents are not receptive to the Poverty Department’s message, but those that join find a sense of purpose, she said.</p>

        <p>“Even though they’re down here and they feel lost in the sauce, music and interacting with them, showing them that we have concern—it makes them feel alive, you know,” Bell said. “We can’t make everybody happy, but those that want to be happy, they come and join, and we show that we care.”</p>

    </div>

<!--Below is the code for the fourth part of the story that is presented-->

    <div class="content4">
        <p>Lisa Bryant has been homeless since the age of 13. After escaping her abusive foster home, Bryant found shelter in the streets. She attended the parade and said living on Skid Row has taught her to overcome obstacles and have faith.</p>

        <p>“Yes, [homelessness is] a time of brokenness. But also, it’s a time of redirection,” Bryant said. “Skid Row doesn't always necessarily mean the outer streets. It can be within our soul. It’s a redirection of where He wants to guide us.”</p>

        <p>While there are many homelessness relief organizations in the area, Mack said the Poverty Department’s emphasis on art gives community members confidence and focus.</p>

        <p>“Artists are the salvation for this thing. I believe that art is the saving grace that was provided by the Creator for us to become connected,” he said. “When an individual leaves his condition on the floor and starts to paint, or starts to sing, they forget about the condition and they start being in the human being.”</p>

        <p>Most of all, members of the LA Poverty Department want to communicate their support for the homeless people of Skid Row. Bell and other volunteers concluded the event singing,</p>

       <p>“Lean on me, when you’re not strong/And I’ll be your friend/I’ll help you carry on.”</p>
